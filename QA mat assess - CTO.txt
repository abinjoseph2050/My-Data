Code Breakdown: Roadmap Creation Process
1. finishAssessment() Method Overview
The finishAssessment() method handles the finalization and submission of an assessment. Here's how it works:

Key Steps:
Validation Check:

Ensures that all sections of the assessment are filled out by checking if tenet.tenetwgtscore is non-zero for every section.
If any section is incomplete, it displays an error message and stops further processing.
User Confirmation:

Asks the user for confirmation before submitting the assessment.
Once confirmed, it proceeds with processing the assessment score.
Calculate Assessment Score:

Loops through the assessment’s tenets and calculates the total score by summing up individual section scores (tenet.tenetwgtscore).
Determine Maturity Level:

Based on the calculated score, assigns a "maturity" level (e.g., CRAWL, WALK, RUN, or SPRINT) that reflects the progress of the assessment.
Prepare Roadmap Collection:

Initializes the roadMapColl array, which will hold the themes and corresponding enablers for the roadmap.
Loop Through Tenets and Enablers:

Iterates through all questions within the tenets to gather enablers (related actions).
If enablers are found, it processes them and associates them with appropriate themes.
2. How roadMapColl Gets Filled
roadMapColl is the key data structure that holds the roadmap, and here's how it is populated:

Enabler Processing:
Check for Enablers:
For each question in the assessment, it checks if any enablers are defined (ques.option.enablers).

Initialize Theme:

The method initTheme(roadMapColl, en.theme) is called to either find an existing theme in roadMapColl or add a new one if not present.
A new theme contains an array for months (12 months, one for each).
Add Enabler to Theme:

Once a theme is found or added, the enabler is placed in the corresponding month.
If the months value of the enabler exceeds 12, it is placed in the last month (month 12).
Check for Dependencies:

If an enabler has a dependency (en.dependson), the method checks if the dependent enabler exists and inserts it into the same month if necessary.
3. Roadmap Array Structure
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the roadmap structure in roadMapColl:

Theme Object Structure:
Each theme in roadMapColl has the following structure:
javascript
Copy
{
  theme: "Theme Name", // Name of the theme
  months: [ [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [] ], // 12 months (January to December)
  maxRec: 0 // Maximum record (optional field to keep track)
}
Populating Months:
The months array for each theme contains sub-arrays representing each month.
Enabler Insertion: Enablers are inserted into the correct month based on the months attribute (1-12).
Dependency Handling: If an enabler depends on another, that dependent enabler is also inserted in the corresponding month if not already there.
4. Roadmap Finalization and UI Display
After the enablers have been processed and inserted into their respective themes and months:

Fix Indexes:
The roadMapColl array is passed through this.serviceMaster.getUtils().fixIndex(roadMapColl) to correct the order and structure (likely organizing the enablers or themes correctly).

Roadmap Ready for Display:
The final roadMapColl is assigned to this.currAssessment.roadmap, which is now ready to be displayed in the UI.

UI Structure:
The roadmap will display each theme and its corresponding enablers for the months, providing a clear action plan.
5. Summary of roadMapColl Population Process
Step-by-Step:
Initialize roadMapColl as an empty array.
Iterate through enablers for each question in the assessment.
Check if the theme exists in roadMapColl. If not, create a new theme with 12 empty months.
Insert enabler into the appropriate month (based on months attribute).
Handle dependencies by checking for any dependent enablers and inserting them where necessary.
Fix and organize the final structure of roadMapColl using fixIndex().
Save and Display the roadmap in the UI.
Code Snippets for Key Methods:
finishAssessment():
